# Smart-Stick-for-Blind-People-using-Logic-Design
Blind people must face many challenges in their life, one of them is finding their way on the streets. On the streets, there are so many vehicles and obstacles that may block their way and may injure them. So, keeping this problem in the mind we developed a Smart blind stick that scans for the obstacles in front of it with the help of three sensors that are further attached to two logic gates which analyze the data and further helps in making the right decision.
